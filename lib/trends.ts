/**
 * Shapes of the national trend files (specs/national-trends.md): `npm run build-trends` writes one JSON file per unit
 * to data/history/trends/, and pages read them with `getTrendFile(name)` (lib/data.ts). Types only.
 *
 * Every file shares the envelope (`TrendEnvelope`): the years it compares, their kind, and the panel size, so pages
 * print years and panel sizes from data, never from copy. Groups under their floor carry `n` and `tooFew: true` and no
 * values.
 *
 * Adding a unit: add its file interface in its own section below and ONE line to `TrendFiles`.
